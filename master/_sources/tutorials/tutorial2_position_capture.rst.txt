Position Capture Tutorial
=========================

This tutorial will introduce you to the Position Capture interface of
PandABlocks, how to provide trigger signals to control when these capture points
are taken and visualize the data.


Loading the tutorial design
---------------------------

Select "template_tutorial2_pcap" from the Design dropdown box and the settings
and wiring of the Blocks in the PandA will be changed to the following:

How the design works
--------------------

This design has two CLOCK Blocks, which are enabled as soon as the PCAP Block
becomes active:

- The first CLOCK is wired to PCAP trigger and gate. The gate is a level driven
  signal that provides the window of time that a capture should be active over.
  The trigger is an edge driven signal that actually captures data. In this
  example, PCAP.TRIG_EDGE="Falling" so capture will be triggered on a falling
  edge of the trigger.
- The second CLOCK is wired to a COUNTER, triggering the increment of the
  counter value.

We start off with both CLOCK Blocks set to a period of 1s, so each second the
COUNTER will increment by one, followed by a PCAP trigger half a second later.
This is best viewed as a timing diagram:

.. timing_plot::
   :path: docs/tutorials/tutorial2.timing.ini
   :section: Trigger Only
   :xlabel: Milliseconds

What PCAP does on that trigger is determined by the PCAP Block settings, and
the contents of the Bits and Positions tables. For Bits you can turn capture
(instantaneous at the time of trigger) on and off. For Positions, you have a
choice of:

============== =======================
Capture        Description
-------------- -----------------------
No             Don't capture
Value          Instantaneous capture at time of trigger
Diff           The difference in the value while gate was high
Sum            The sum of all the samples while gate was high
Min            The smallest value seen while gate was high
Max            The largest value seen while gate was high
Mean           The average value seen while gate was high
Min Max        Capture both Min and Max
Min Max Mean   Capture Min Max and Mean
============== =======================

There are also a handful of other fields like the start of frame, end of frame
and trigger time that can be captured by setting fields on the PCAP Block. If
you click on the PCAP Block you will see them in the Outputs section:

.. image:: tutorial2_pcap.png

In the inputs section of the PCAP Block we can see that we have set a delay of
1 for both the Trig and Gate. Delays on bit inputs are in FPGA clock ticks, and
are there to compensate for different length data paths that need to be aligned.
Each Block and each wire in PandA take 1 clock tick each. In this example, both
COUNTER1 and PCAP are being triggered by a CLOCK in the same clock tick, but
we want to delay the input to PCAP by one clock tick so that it sees the updated
COUNTER1 value *after* the corresponding CLOCK rising edge.

.. note::

   The delay fields of the PCAP Block are also shown as small badges on the
   input ports of the Block

We can set COUNTER1.OUT to capture the Value at trigger by modifying the
Positions table and pressing Submit:

Now we can get a client ready to receive data. We can capture data in ASCII or
Binary format as detailed in the TCP server documentation, and TANGO and EPICS
have clients to do this. For this tutorial we will just use the ASCII format on
the commandline to check::

   $ nc <panda-ip> 8889

Here we could specify binary output and header format, but we'll just stick
with the default ASCII output (the default). Press Return again, and we will
see::

   OK

Now go back to the PandA layout and select the PCAP Block, pressing the ARM
button. The Active light will go on and data will start streaming in the
terminal window until Disarm is pressed::

   missed: 0
   process: Scaled
   format: ASCII
   fields:
    COUNTER1.OUT double Value scale: 1 offset: 0 units:

    1
    2
    3
    4
   END 4 Disarmed

This tallies with the timing diagram we saw above, the captured value matches
the instantaneous value of COUNTER1.OUT when PCAP.TRIG went high.

We will now make the COUNTER1.OUT increment 5 times faster. Set CLOCK2.PERIOD
to 0.2s, and click PCAP.ARM and you will see the captured value change::

   missed: 0
   process: Scaled
   format: ASCII
   fields:
    COUNTER1.OUT double Value scale: 1 offset: 0 units:

    3
    8
    13
    18
   END 4 Disarmed

If we look at the timing plot, we can see this also matched what we expect, the
value is captured mid way through each increment of 5:

.. timing_plot::
   :path: docs/tutorials/tutorial2.timing.ini
   :section: Trigger Counter 5x faster
   :xlabel: Milliseconds

Now let's investigate the other options. If we change the Positions table
so COUNTER1.OUT captures the Diff instead of Value then we will see it captures
the difference between the value at the rising edge of the gate, and the
falling edge::

   missed: 0
   process: Scaled
   format: ASCII
   fields:
    COUNTER1.OUT double Diff scale: 1 offset: 0 units:

    2
    2
    2
    2
   END 4 Disarmed

This again matches the timing plot, GATE rises when COUNTER was at 1, and falls
at 3, then rises at 6 and falls at 8.

.. note::

   If we hadn't put in the 1 clock tick delays for Gate and Trig then we would
   see 3 rather than 2, as GATE would rise at 0 and fall at 3, then rise at 5
   and fall at 8

This capture output is generally used with COUNTER Blocks connected to an input
fed from a V2F_ to capture the total counts produced in a given time window.

If we change COUNTER1.OUT to capture Min Max and Mean, we will see the other
options::

   missed: 0
   process: Scaled
   format: ASCII
   fields:
    COUNTER1.OUT double Min scale: 1 offset: 0 units:
    COUNTER1.OUT double Max scale: 1 offset: 0 units:
    COUNTER1.OUT double Mean scale: 1 offset: 0 units:

    1 3 1.8
    6 8 6.8
    11 13 11.8
    16 18 16.8
   END 4 Disarmed

Here we can see our min and max values as we expected, and also the Mean of
the COUNTER value during the total gate::

   # (sum of counter_value * time_at_value) / gate_time = mean
   (1 * 0.2 + 2 * 0.2 + 3 * 0.1) / 0.5 = 1.8
   (6 * 0.2 + 7 * 0.2 + 8 * 0.1) / 0.5 = 6.8

This capture output is generally used with encoders, to give the min, max and
mean value of the encoder over a detector frame.

Conclusion
----------

This tutorial has shown how to use the Position Capture interface of a PandA
to capture entries on the position bus, and introduced the different capture
types. It has also introduced the COUNTER block that is useful connecting to
the pulse train produced by a V2F_. In the next tutorial we will read about
how to use position compare to generate triggers from position outputs, and
how to configure position capture to work with it.
