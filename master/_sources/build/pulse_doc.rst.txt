PULSE - One-shot pulse delay and stretch
========================================

A PULSE block produces configurable width output pulses with an optional delay
based on its parameters. It operates in one of two modes:

- If WIDTH=0, then it acts as a delay line. The input pulse train will just be
  replayed after the given DELAY
- If WIDTH is non-zero, then each pulse edge that matches TRIG_EDGE will be
  delayed by the specified DELAY, then generate NPULSES pulses of width WIDTH,
  with rising edges separated by STEP

Fields
------

.. block_fields:: modules/pulse/pulse.block.ini

Delay line
----------

If WIDTH=0, then the Block acts as a delay line. DELAY must either be 0 or
5+ clock ticks. TRIG_EDGE, STEP, and NPULSES are ignored.

If DELAY=0 the Block is a simple pass through:

.. timing_plot::
   :path: modules/pulse/pulse.timing.ini
   :section: No delay or stretch

If DELAY is non-zero, rising and falling edges will be inserted in the queue and
output after the given DELAY:

.. timing_plot::
   :path: modules/pulse/pulse.timing.ini
   :section: Pulse delay with no stretch

0 < DELAY < 5 will be treated as DELAY=5:

.. timing_plot::
   :path: modules/pulse/pulse.timing.ini
   :section: No WIDTH means a delay of 5 or more is required

Pulse train generation
----------------------

If WIDTH != 0 then the Block will operate in pulse train mode. If NPULSES is
0 or 1 then it will produce a single pulse for each matching input pulse:

.. timing_plot::
   :path: modules/pulse/pulse.timing.ini
   :section: Pulse delay and stretch

The output pulses are queued, so multiple pulses can be queued before output:

.. timing_plot::
   :path: modules/pulse/pulse.timing.ini
   :section: Pulse train stretched and delayed

The TRIG_EDGE field can be used to select whether an input pulse queues an
output on rising, falling, or both edges:

.. timing_plot::
   :path: modules/pulse/pulse.timing.ini
   :section: Pulse stretching with no delay activate on rising edge

.. timing_plot::
   :path: modules/pulse/pulse.timing.ini
   :section: Pulse stretching with no delay activate on falling edge

.. timing_plot::
   :path: modules/pulse/pulse.timing.ini
   :section: Pulse stretching with no delay activate on both edges

0 < WIDTH < 5 will be treated as WIDTH=5:

.. timing_plot::
   :path: modules/pulse/pulse.timing.ini
   :section: No delay means a WIDTH of 5 or more is required

If PULSES > 1 then multiple output pulses will be generated, separated by STEP:

.. timing_plot::
   :path: modules/pulse/pulse.timing.ini
   :section: Multiple pulses with no delay

.. timing_plot::
   :path: modules/pulse/pulse.timing.ini
   :section: Small delay width combination

Pulse period error
------------------

The following example shows what happens when the period between pulses is too
short. To avoid running output pulses together, the DROPPED field is incremented
and the input is dropped:

.. timing_plot::
   :path: modules/pulse/pulse.timing.ini
   :section: Stretched and delayed pulses too close together

The queue length is 255, so if QUEUED reaches 255 then any new pulse will
be dropped and also increment DROPPED.

The DROPPED count is zeroed on rising edge of ENABLE.

Enabling the Block
------------------

There is an Enable signal that stops the Block from producing signals. Edges
must occur while Enable is high to trigger a pulse creation

.. timing_plot::
   :path: modules/pulse/pulse.timing.ini
   :section: No pulses if disabled

If enable is dropped mid way through a pulse train, the output is set low and
the QUEUED output is set to zero.

.. timing_plot::
   :path: modules/pulse/pulse.timing.ini
   :section: Multiple pulses interrupted

Changing parameters while Enabled
---------------------------------

If any of the input parameters are changed while enabled, the queue is dropped
and the state of the Block is reset:

.. timing_plot::
   :path: modules/pulse/pulse.timing.ini
   :section: Changing parameters resets pulses
