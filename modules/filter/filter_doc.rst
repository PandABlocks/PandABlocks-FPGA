FILTER - Filter
========================

The filter block has two different modes of operation: Difference and Average.
They both work by latching the values on the input and performing an operation
comparing to the current value.

Difference
----------------------------

The difference operation works by latching the value on the input on the rising
edge of the Enable signal. On a rising edge of the trigger signal the output is
given as the the current input value minus the latched value.

   :section: Difference mode

After the operation, the latched value is updated to be the current value on
the input.

The operation continues to work if the current value is less than the latched
value: a negative result is outputted

   :section: Difference mode negative ramping input

Average
----------------

The average function appends a sum value on each clock pulse. When a trigger
signal is received it divides the summed value by the number of clock pulses
that have passed.

   :section: Average mode negative ramp

If a calculation is triggered before the calculation is ready, the system will
show an error on the HEALTH output and will then need to be re-enabled before
another calculation can be sent.
