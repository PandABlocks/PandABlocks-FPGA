SEQ - Sequencer
===============================
The sequencer block performs automatic execution of sequenced lines to produce
timing signals. Each line optionally waits for an external trigger condition and
runs for an optional phase1, then a mandatory phase2 before moving to the next
line. Each line sets the block outputs during phase1 and phase2 as defined by
user-configured mask. Individual lines can be repeated, and the whole table
can be repeated, with a value of 0 meaning repeat forever.

Generating fixed pulse trains
-----------------------------

The basic use case is for generating fixed pulse trains when enabled. For
example we can ask for 3x 50% duty cycle pulses by writing a single line table
that is repeated 3 times. When enabled it will become active and immediately
start producing pulses, remaining active until the pulses have been produced:

.. timing_plot::
   :path: modules/seq/seq.timing.ini
   :section: 3 evenly spaced pulses

We can also use it to generate irregular streams of pulses on different outputs
by adding more lines to the table. Note that OUTB which was high at the end
of Phase2 of the first line remains high in Phase1 of the second line:

.. timing_plot::
   :path: modules/seq/seq.timing.ini
   :section: Irregular pulses

And we can set repeats on the entire table too. Note that in the second line of
this table we have suppressed phase1 by setting its time to 0:

.. timing_plot::
   :path: modules/seq/seq.timing.ini
   :section: Table repeats

There are 6 outputs which allow for complex patterns to be generated:

.. timing_plot::
   :path: modules/seq/seq.timing.ini
   :section: Using all 6 outputs

Statemachine
------------

There is an internal statemachine that controls which phase is currently being
output. It has a number of transitions that allow it to skip PHASE1 if there is
none, or skip WAIT_TRIGGER if there is no trigger condition.

.. digraph:: pcomp_sm

    WAIT_ENABLE [label="State 0\nWAIT_ENABLE"]
    UNREADY [label="State 1\nUNREADY"]
    WAIT_TRIGGER [label="State 2\nWAIT_TRIGGER"]
    PHASE1 [label="State 3\nPHASE1"]
    PHASE2 [label="State 4\nPHASE2"]

    WAIT_ENABLE -> UNREADY [label=" TABLE load started "]
    WAIT_ENABLE -> WAIT_TRIGGER [label=" rising ENABLE and trigger not met "]
    WAIT_ENABLE -> PHASE1 [label=" rising ENABLE and trigger met "]
    WAIT_ENABLE -> PHASE2 [label=" rising ENABLE and trigger met and no phase1 "]

    UNREADY -> WAIT_ENABLE [label=" TABLE load complete "]

    WAIT_TRIGGER -> UNREADY [label=" TABLE load started "]
    WAIT_TRIGGER -> PHASE1 [label=" trigger met "]
    WAIT_TRIGGER -> PHASE2 [label=" trigger met and no phase1 "]

    PHASE1 -> UNREADY [label=" TABLE load started "]
    PHASE1 -> PHASE2 [label=" time1 elapsed "]

    PHASE2 -> UNREADY [label=" TABLE load started "]
    PHASE2 -> WAIT_TRIGGER [label=" next trigger not met "]
    PHASE2 -> PHASE1 [label=" next trigger met "]
    PHASE2 -> PHASE2 [label=" next trigger met and no phase1 "]


External trigger sources
------------------------

The trigger column in the table allows an optional trigger condition to be
waited on before the phased times are started. The trigger condition is checked
on each repeat of the line, but not checked during phase1 and phase2. You can
see when the Block is waiting for a trigger signal as it will enter the
WAIT_TRIGGER(2) state:

.. timing_plot::
   :path: modules/seq/seq.timing.ini
   :section: Waiting on bit inputs

You can also use a position field as a trigger condition in the same way, this
is useful to do a table based position compare:

.. timing_plot::
   :path: modules/seq/seq.timing.ini
   :section: Table based position compare


Prescaler
---------

Each row of the table gives a time value for the phases. This value can be
scaled with a block wide prescaler to allow a frame to be longer than
2**32 * 8e-9 = about 34 seconds. For example:

.. timing_plot::
   :path: modules/seq/seq.timing.ini
   :section: Prescaled pulses


Interrupting a sequence
-----------------------

Setting the repeats on a table row to 0 will cause it to iterate until
interrupted by a falling ENABLE signal:

.. timing_plot::
   :path: modules/seq/seq.timing.ini
   :section: Infinite repeats of a row interrupted

In a similar way, REPEATS=0 on a table will cause the whole table to be
iterated until interrupted by a falling ENABLE signal:

.. timing_plot::
   :path: modules/seq/seq.timing.ini
   :section: Infinite repeats of a table interrupted

And a rising edge of the ENABLE will re-run the same table from the start:

.. timing_plot::
   :path: modules/seq/seq.timing.ini
   :section: Restarting the same table


Table rewriting
---------------

If a table is written while enabled, the outputs and table state are reset and
operation begins again from the first repeat of the first line of the table:

.. timing_plot::
   :path: modules/seq/seq.timing.ini
   :section: Rewriting a table

Double table mode
-----------------
A table ending with a zeroed entry indicates that there will be a next table,
a new table can be pushed as soon as CAN_WRITE_NEXT becomes 1.
The user is responsible to push a table that gives enough time to be able to
push the next table before the last line is reached.
The last table will not contain the last zeroed entry and will be the only table
that will be repeated according to the REPEATS register.
