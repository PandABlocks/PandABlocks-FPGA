extension: kD
extension_write: RESERVED_G1D RESERVED_G2D
scale: 7.8125e-3

[F_FILTER]
type: param scalar
description: Derivative filter cutoff frequency (Hz); must be < Fsampling/4 (NOT Fs/2); if in doubt, put it to Fs/5
extension: f_filter

scale: 976.5625e-6
units: Hz

[F_SAMPLING]
type: param scalar
description: Sampling Frequecy (Hz, in range [1Hz,1MHz]); it must correspond to the frequency of the clock applied to "sample_clk" pin
extension: f_sample
extension_write: RESERVED_GI RESERVED_G1D RESERVED_G2D
scale: 1
units: Hz

[CMD]
type: pos_mux
description: Command (desired value)

[MEAS]
type: pos_mux
description: Actual measured value

[OUT]
type: pos_out
description: Control to plant 
scale: 4.656612873e-10

[THRESH]
type: param scalar
description: Input threshold (full scale=1) no action is taken if the input error (=CMD-MEAS) is below this threshold: it is a deadband. This value can be 0.
scale: 9.313225746e-10
units: FS1

[MAX_OUT]
type: param scalar
description: Output saturation limit (full scale=1)
scale: 9.313225746e-10

[ANTI_INT_WNDP_RAT_G]
type: param scalar
description: Back calculation rational gain for anti integral windup. It is the ratio of kB (back calculation gain) and kI (integral gain). Usually, it should be =1; putting it to 0 disables the anti-integral windup.
