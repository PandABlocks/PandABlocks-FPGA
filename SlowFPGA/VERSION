# FPGA version for PMC-SFP design
# Version Number is held on NEUTRINO_BUILD_NO register
# Diamond Communication controller version is controlled separately.

# The FPGA version number is packed into the version number register in the
# following format:
#
#   FPGA_VER_REGISTER = 0000xyyz
#
# where x.yy is the major and minor version number encoded in BCD -- this
# should, as far as possible, track the corresponding i-Tech version number.
# To this we add a point version z which can go up to 15.

# Specify three point version here in decimal

FPGA_VER_MINOR = 1
